1. Start mininet with 3 hosts
sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --controller remote --switch ovsk
2. Enable OFv13
sudo ovs-vsctl set bridge s1 protocols=OpenFlow13
3. Start the monitoring script
cd /home/ubuntu/ryu && ./bin/ryu-manager --verbose <correct path to ids_main>.py

4. xterm h1 h2 h3

5. At h1
run echo_server.py
6. At h2
run echo_client.py
7. At h3
run echo_client_fast.py

# To test the rules:
The default rules currently in place will:

1. print an alert message when h1 -> h2 exceeds 10pps
   This can be verified by "h1 ping -i .01 h2" from the mininet prompt
2. disallow h2 -> h3 traffic
   This can be verified by "h2 ping h3" from the mininet prompt
   "sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1" should show a "drop" action 
   rule for 10.0.0.2 -> 10.0.0.3
3. drop h1 -> h3 traffic when it exceeds 10 pps
   This can be verified by "h1 ping -i .01 h3" from mininet prompt
   You should see some packets getting response and then it should stop. Again
   dump the flows to see "drop" action rule for h1 -> h3
